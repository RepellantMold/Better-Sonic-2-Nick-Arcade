# Better Sonic 2 Nick Arcade
## Change Log
* Constants were added to make handling variables much easier.
* ID's were added for art loading and for level mappings etc.
* SonLVL compatibility was added (Green Hill is impossible to edit due to how the game reads it's chunk data, along with it's own custom layout format).
* Everything possible of the code was commented as well as data being reorganized along with the art being compiled so that it was possible to edit with SonMapEd or Flex2 (Some data couldn't be compiled)
